- 👋 Hi, I’m @pabloSanchezBB
- 👀 I’m interested in Embedded Systems, App Development, Microarchitecture and Game Modding
- 🌱 I’m currently writing a Java Social Media App to learn more about App Development, along with writing some Arduino Drivers in C, and then some LeetCode practice
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on App Design, particularly with Social Media Apps. The        practice app I'm making is an idea I think has some promise, so any advice or ideas is super appreciated.
- 📫 How to reach me: t.rowland711@gmail.com
