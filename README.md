- 👋 Hi, I’m @pabloSanchezBB
- 👀 I’m interested in Embedded Systems, App Development, Microarchitecture and Game Modding
- 🌱 I’m currently writing some Java Apps for Android to learn more about App Development, learning Python, writing some Arduino Drivers in C, and then some LeetCode practice in Java, and Python and C later on
- 💞️ I'm currently just doing some solo projects and teaching myself concepts but if you want to make any criticisms that would be great, and super helpful!
- 📫 How to reach me: t.rowland711@gmail.com
