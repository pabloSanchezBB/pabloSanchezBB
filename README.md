- 👋 Hi, I’m @pabloSanchezBB
- 👀 I’m interested in Embedded Systems, App Development, Microarchitecture and Game Modding
- 🌱 Here's what I am currently working on:
      - Custom, Affordable B0xx Style Controllers
      - Java Apps for Android(Social Media App and an AAC App for Nonverbal Speech)
      - Python(Just getting familiar rn but want to make some basic projects)
      - C for Arduino(Not much right now and this might change to be C for the Raspberry Pi)
      - LeetCode(Java for now but C and Python in the future)
- 💞️ I'm currently just doing some solo projects and teaching myself concepts but if you want to make any criticisms I'd love to hear it!

FOR ANY EMPLOYERS/PEOPLE LOOKING FOR MY SCHOOL PROJECTS: 
Please send me an Email if you wish to view the VHDL Based MIPS Processor or the ChessOrSomething Android App, I can't publish them here as that would violate ISU's Academic Integrity Policy. Thanks for understanding!
